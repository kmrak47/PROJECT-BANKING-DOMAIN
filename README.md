Project Title: Issuance of Credit Cards Based on Spending and Income by Occupation Grouped by Five Cities

Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze the issuance of credit cards by a bank, based on customers' spending patterns and income levels across different occupation groups in five major cities. This analysis aims to provide insights into the relationship between income, spending, and credit card issuance, ultimately helping the bank optimize its credit card offerings and marketing strategies.

Data sources included transaction logs, customer profiles, and income reports.
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Cleaned the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
Standardized income and spending data to ensure consistency across different cities and occupations.
Data Analysis:

Analyzed the data to identify patterns and trends in credit card issuance.
Grouped data by occupation and city to understand the distribution of income and spending within these groups.
Visualization in Power BI:

Created interactive dashboards and visualizations in Power BI to represent the data clearly and effectively.
Key visualizations included:
